\title{Performs single-cell data quality control}
\usage{
scQC(
  X,
  minLibSize = 1000,
  removeOutlierCells = TRUE,
  minPCT = 0.05,
  maxMTratio = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Raw counts matrix with cells as columns and genes (symbols) as rows.}

\item{minLibSize}{An integer value. Defines the minimum library size required for a cell to be included in the analysis.}

\item{removeOutlierCells}{A boolean value (\code{TRUE/FALSE}), if \code{TRUE}, the identified cells with library size greater than 1.58 IQR/sqrt(n) computed from the sample, are removed. For further details see: \code{?boxplot.stats}}

\item{minPCT}{A decimal value between 0 and 1. Defines the minimum fraction of cells where the gene needs to be expressed to be included in the analysis.}

\item{maxMTratio}{A decimal value between 0 and 1. Defines the maximum ratio of mitochondrial reads (mithocondrial reads / library size) present in a cell to be included in the analysis. It's computed using the symbol genes starting with 'MT-' non-case sensitive.}
}
\value{
A dgCMatrix object with the cells and the genes that pass the quality control filters.
}
\description{
This function performs quality control filters over the provided input matrix, the function checks for minimum cell library size, mitochondrial ratio, outlier cells, and the fraction of cells where a gene is expressed.
